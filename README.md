🌍 A real-time disaster management platform built with MERN stack, enabling SOS reporting, volunteer coordination, and AI-powered disaster prediction

# ResQ Connect 🚨  
*A MERN-powered Disaster Management Platform*

## 🌍 Overview
ResQ Connect is a **disaster management system** designed to provide real-time communication and coordination during natural calamities.  
It enables **citizens, volunteers, NGOs, and authorities** to connect seamlessly for effective rescue and relief operations.  

## ✨ Key Features
- 🆘 **SOS Reporting** – Citizens can raise emergency alerts with location details.  
- 🗺 **Interactive Map** – Real-time disaster zones & SOS pins visualized.  
- 🤝 **Volunteer & Resource Management** – Efficient allocation of people & resources.  
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Predictions** – Disaster risk forecasts integrated into the dashboard.  
- 📱 **PWA & Offline Mode** – Works even in low-network areas.  
- 🔔 **Real-Time Alerts** – Instant updates using WebSockets.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS, Leaflet.js (Maps)  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Realtime:** Socket.io  
- **AI/ML Integration:** Python APIs (via Flask/FastAPI)  

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Citizen raises SOS → sent to backend (MongoDB).  
2. Data is broadcast via WebSockets → Map Dashboard updates in real time.  
3. Volunteers/Authorities can allocate resources or mark SOS as resolved.  
4. AI model predicts disaster risks → displayed in charts & alerts.  
5. PWA support → works offline & syncs when internet is restored.  

## 👥 Team Roles
- **MERN Team:** Backend, APIs, real-time updates, PWA integration.  
- **Web Dev Team:** UI/UX design, static frontend, responsive layouts.  
- **AI/ML Team:** Predictive analytics, risk modeling, data insights.
